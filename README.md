# Overview : Lab 12 Printer Setup on Server 2022, NTFS Permissions
This repository documents my home lab focused on Printer Setup on Server 2022 and NTFS Permissions using VirtualBox. The lab explores configuring printers on a Windows Server 2022 machine, setting up shared printers for network use, and managing NTFS file permissions to control access to shared resources.

## Objectives

- Printer Setup on Server 2022: Learn how to install and configure printers on Windows Server 2022 and share them with network users.
- NTFS Permissions: Understand how to set and manage NTFS file permissions for controlling access to shared resources on the server.
- Printer Sharing: Configure printer sharing and permissions to ensure that only authorized users can access and print to the shared printers.

## Documentation
In this home lab, we will focus on how to install and configure network printers, as well as explore file and printer security through NTFS permissions.

Let's open up Server Manager on our Windows Server 2022 VM. Select Manage ‚Üí Add Roles and Features.

11. Now, when we look into the properties of our new printer, we can see the different settings we can configure. For example, if we wanted to list the printer in Active Directory for another user to install, we could do that in the Sharing tab. We will enable this in just a bit.

<br> 

16. Now, we can see in the Security tab that HR is a member of this security group, and it shows the permissions HR has for this printer. This printer should also automatically show up for anyone in the HR group.

<br>
